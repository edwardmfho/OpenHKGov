# OpenHKGov
Hello, glad to have you on board, Welcome to to OpenHKGov.

As we all know, it is not easy to use the data "published" by the Hong Kong Government. One of the reasons is that they did not include a useful format for data analysis task. To solve this issue, we are trying to build a a open-source Python Library to make data extraction easier for everyone, or at least someone with basic Python programming skills. 

# What you can do?

We are at an very early stage of programming, in fact, I just came up with this idea, create a repo, right after an indoor futsal game. Please feel free to leave your feedback, comments or suggestions for us - and that include how to write a better README file (Spoiler alert: I am a beginner developer) 

Thanks again for your interest in this project, looking forward to see you soon. Happy coding.
